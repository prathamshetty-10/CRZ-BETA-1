# CRZ-BETA 🙌(Work In Progress)

The Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Web App is a digital solution developed and optimized to streamline the process of obtaining construction and convertion clearances for coastal land in the Udupi District. This project was undertaken for the Udupi District Deputy Commissioner's Office with a primary focus on enhancing user experience and accessibility, particularly for the elderly population.


## Problem Statement and Solution😎


- Previously, the clearance process was entirely manual, leading to numerous complications and delays, especially affecting older residents who found the traditional methods cumbersome and challenging.
- The CRZ Web App digitalizes the entire clearance process, making it more efficient, transparent, and user-friendly. By transitioning to a web-based platform, we have significantly reduced the time and effort required to obtain necessary approvals, ensuring a smoother and more accessible experience for all users.

## 🔗 Website Link
- The CRZ Web App project is currently in progress due to ongoing modifications requested by district officials. These changes aim to further improve the application's functionality and compliance with new regulatory requirements. 
- Additionally, there has been a significant shift in the project's technical infrastructure, necessitated by the officials' decision to transition the database from MySQL to SQL Server. 
- This change is crucial for enhancing data management capabilities and ensuring better integration with existing government systems, leading to some delays as we adapt and optimize the application accordingly.
